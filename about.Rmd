This document was developed to support the goals of the ESCA Signage Committee:
  
  - Promoting the health and safety of people on ESCA lands through signage.
  - Developing cohesive standards for planning, designing, fabricating, ordering, installing, and maintaining signs consistently.
  - Consider (when appropriate) adopting BLM signage standards to achieve consistency between ESCA areas and the adjacent BLM system.
  
## Types of Signage Proposed

The four types of signage proposed at the ESCA Signage Committee include:

  &emsp; <img src = "imgs/information.png" width = "2%"> &ensp; *Usage Control:* Present acceptable and unacceptable uses at entry points.
  
  &emsp; <img src = "imgs/no-entry.png" width = "2%"> &ensp; *Restricted Area:* Notify land users of access restrictions and list applicable municipal code.
  
  &emsp; <img src = "imgs/gate.png" width = "2%"> &ensp; *Gate Access:* Identify high traffic gates around former Fort Ord, making it easier for emergency responders to identify their location.
  
  &emsp; <img src = "imgs/direction.png" width = "2%"> &ensp; *Directional: Trail:* Aid users in understanding the trail network and how to best use the land.
  
<table style = "border: 1px black solid;"><tr><td style = "padding: 10px; text-align: left; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-size: 12px;">
**Note:** *Directional: Trail Signage* locations have not been included in this proposal. As discussed during the ESCA Signage Committee, land owning jurisdictions must first determine which trails will be sanctioned within their respective land prior to determining where signs should be placed.
</td></tr></table>
