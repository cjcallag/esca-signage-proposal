This document was developed to support the goals of the ESCA Signage Committee:
  
  - Promoting the health and safety of people on ESCA lands through signage.
  - Developing cohesive standards for planning, designing, fabricating, ordering, installing, and maintaining signs consistently.
  
## Types of Signage Proposed

The four types of signage proposed at the ESCA Signage Committee include:

  - *Usage Control Signage:* Present acceptable and unacceptable uses at entry points.
  - *Restricted Area Signage:* Notify land users of access restrictions and list applicable municipal code.
  - *Gate Access Signage:* Identify high traffic gates around former Fort Ord, making it easier for emergency responders to identify their location.
  - *Directional Trail Signage:* Aid users in understanding the trail network and how to best use the land.
  
## Disclaimer
  
This document is designed to serve as a visual aid for planners. The views expressed here are not those of the authors, the landowners or any regulatory agency associated with the former Fort Ord.
